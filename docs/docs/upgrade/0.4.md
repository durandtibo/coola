# 0.3 to 0.4

This page explains how to migrate from `coola` 0.3 to 0.4 because `coola` 0.4 introduces several
non-backward compatible changes.

## `objects_are_equal/allclose`

The signature of the `objects_are_equal` and `objects_are_allclose` function were updated:

- `object1` was renamed to `actual`
- `object2` was renamed to `expected`

The same changes were made in the associated classes to be consistent:

- `BaseEqualityComparator`
- `BaseEqualityHandler`
- `BaseEqualityTester`
