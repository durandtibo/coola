# 0.2 to 0.3

This page explains how to migrate from `coola` 0.2 to 0.3 because `coola` 0.3 introduces several
non-backward compatible changes due to the redesign of the equality mechanism.

## `objects_are_equal/allclose`

The signature of the `objects_are_equal` and `objects_are_allclose` function were updated and only
the first two arguments can be provided as positional arguments.
All the other arguments had to be provided as keyword arguments.
Both functions take a `BaseEqualityTester` as `tester` argument.

## `objects_are_equal`

`coola` 0.3 also introduces a new parameter `equal_nan` to `objects_are_equal` to indicate whether
to compare NaNâ€™s as equal.
To keep the behavior similar as `coola` 0.2, the default value of `equal_nan` is `False`.

```pycon title="coola 0.2 (old)"
>>> from coola import objects_are_equal
>>> objects_are_equal(float("nan"), float("nan"))
False

```

```pycon title="coola 0.3 (new)"
>>> from coola import objects_are_equal
>>> objects_are_equal(float("nan"), float("nan"))
False
>>> objects_are_equal(float("nan"), float("nan"), equal_nan=True)
True

```

## Equality mechanism

The equality mechanism was fully redesigned in `coola` 0.3 to merge the two existing equality
mechanisms.
In `coola` 0.2, there were two equality mechanisms:

- a mechanism to check if two objects are equal (mechanism behind `objects_are_equal`)
- a mechanism to check if two objects are equal within tolerance (mechanism
  behind `objects_are_allclose`)

This approach was not scalable because there were a lot of overlap and duplicate code between the
two mechanisms.
For each new type to support, it was necessary to implement two comparators: one inheriting
from `BaseEqualityOperator` and another one inheriting from `BaseAllCloseOperator`.
In the long term, fusing the two mechanisms will make the code easier to maintain and extend.
The new equality mechanism combines two previous equality mechanisms in a single equality mechanism
so it is necessary to implement only a single comparator for each type.

`BaseEqualityOperator` has a new interface which is similar but not directly compatible with the old
interface.
The new interface introduces a new data structure `EqualityConfig` to keep the interface simpler and
to make the fusion easier.
`EqualityConfig` stores all the parameters that controls the equality mechanism, like the absolute
or relative tolerance thresholds.
Below is a simplified version of the interface. Please check the code to see all the details.

```python title="coola 0.3 (new interface)"
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Any, Generic, TypeVar

from coola.equality.config import EqualityConfig

T = TypeVar("T")


class BaseEqualityComparator(ABC, Generic[T]):
    @abstractmethod
    def equal(self, object1: T, object2: Any, config: EqualityConfig) -> bool:
        pass
```

Note that in most of the cases, it will not be necessary to change the overall logic inside
the `equal` method.

The redesign of the equality mechanism introduces the following main changes:

- The class `BaseAllCloseOperator` has been removed as well as all its child classes.
- `coola.comparators` has been removed and an equivalent package has been
  added `coola.equality.comparators`. Please note that `coola.equality.comparators` is not a direct
  replacement of `coola.comparators` because `BaseEqualityOperator` has new interface.
- `coola.testers` has been removed and an equivalent package has been
  added `coola.equality.testers`. Please note that `coola.equality.testers` is not a direct
  replacement of `coola.testers` because `BaseEqualityOperator` has new interface.
